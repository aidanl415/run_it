# I've taught 7th - 12th Grade science for four years. I've struggled to give substantive, targeted feedback while still having a life. With this code, I add grades based on lab report writing standards to an excel sheet along with comment codes. The Python code creates full paragraphs of feedback and an explanation of the grade for each student. Life reclaimed!
